                explanation: "A training method that includes 'adversarial' data (fake or cleverly manipulated data) designed to trick or confuse the AI model, in order to make the model smarter and safer. Through this, the model learns how to better defend against and function correctly when faced with various types of unexpected inputs or attacks. It's akin to vaccination, where exposure to weak attacks prepares for stronger ones.",

                explanation: "Refers to the process of ensuring an AI system acts in accordance with the goals and values intended by the developer or user. It can be likened to 'training' or 'domesticating' the AI to operate beneficially without diverging from human intent. Failure to achieve alignment means the AI could act harmfully in unexpected ways and is considered one of the severe risks that AGI could pose.",

                koreanTerm: "정렬 스트레스 테스트",
                explanation: "A process of testing an AI system's tendency to act against the developer's intent or human values (misalignment) by deliberately creating extreme situations or tricky conditions. It is similar to crash-testing a car to evaluate its safety under extreme conditions. Red teams actively seek counterexamples showing that key assumptions in the AI's alignment plan are incorrect, thus evaluating the robustness of current alignment methods or identifying vulnerabilities.",
                koreanExplanation: "AI가 개발자 의도나 인간 가치에서 벗어나도록 일부러 극한 상황을 만들어 시험하는 과정입니다."

                explanation: "A system where human supervision is enhanced by AI assistance, using AI systems themselves to process complex information and identify potential risks/deviations for human reviewers. This approach allows humans to effectively oversee advanced AI whose behavior is too complex to monitor manually.",
                koreanExplanation: "AI 시스템 자체를 활용하여 인간의 감독 능력을 강화하고 효율성을 높이는 기법입니다."

                koreanTerm: "대략적 연속성 가정",
                explanation: "The assumption that the general capabilities of AI will improve relatively smoothly and predictably, without sudden 'large leaps,' as invested data, R&D effort, and computing resources gradually increase. (Note that the acceleration of the pace of development over time is separate from this assumption). Thanks to this assumption, we can have hope in testing AI safety strategies incrementally and proactively identifying and addressing problems as AI capabilities develop.",

                explanation: "Refers to AI that can perform various intellectual tasks by thinking and learning like a human. In this paper, it is specifically defined as 'AI systems matching or surpassing highly skilled adults (top 1%) across numerous non-physical task domains,' seeing them as potentially bringing significant progress to humanity while also posing severe risks. AGI possesses the potential to learn autonomously, solve novel problems, and exhibit human-like levels of understanding and creativity.",

                koreanTerm: "블랙박스 문제",
                explanation: "Refers to the technical difficulty in understanding the internal reasoning process of complex AI models, particularly deep neural networks. Because the decision-making process is not easily interpretable by humans, it is challenging to diagnose errors, identify biases, ensure safety, or fully trust the system's output. This problem highlights the importance of interpretability research.",

                koreanTerm: "제한된 자율성",
                explanation: "A design approach that deliberately limits the scope of an AI system's autonomy, allowing it to perform specific tasks only within a clearly defined scope, rather than granting it full autonomy, similar to how humans use tools or services. By limiting the areas where AI can make decisions and act to clearly defined resources and permitted tasks, this safety-oriented approach aims to reduce the possibility of the AI unexpectedly becoming uncontrollable or performing dangerous actions.",
                koreanExplanation: "AI 시스템에게 완전한 자율성을 부여하기보다 명확히 정의된 범위 내에서만 특정 작업을 수행하도록 자율성을 제한하는 설계 방식입니다."

                explanation: "A practical AI technique where, upon receiving an inappropriate, risky, or unethical request, the AI actively suggests positive, safe, and ethical alternatives. The goal is to transform a negative or harmful intent into a learning opportunity or a constructive behavior, supporting user growth and safe outcomes.",

                koreanTerm: "통제 안전 사례",
                explanation: "An approach that argues an AI system is safe because strong safety features (e.g., monitoring systems, access restrictions) are in place that can effectively detect and block dangerous behaviors, even if the AI has a tendency to act against developer intent (misalignment). This approach relies on external 'control' systems to ensure safety, rather than depending on the AI itself being perfectly 'good'.",

                explanation: "A desirable attribute where an AI system does not resist but cooperates when a developer or user attempts to modify its goals or behaviors, or even helps by providing necessary information to facilitate such modifications, while maintaining a controllable state itself. This is the opposite of (potentially risky) instrumental goals where the AI sticks to its current goals and attempts to hinder or evade developer intervention. It is considered essential for safe AGI development.",

                explanation: "The assumption that the current main methodologies for developing AI technology (e.g., scaling up model size by investing more data and computing resources) will continue to be the dominant trend in AI development for a considerable period. This assumption explains why the safety techniques proposed in the paper are not tailored to suddenly appearing new AI development methods but should be designed as an 'Anytime' approach applicable whenever needed.",

                explanation: "As one concrete example of an amplified oversight method, this involves having two AI systems argue different sides of a specific topic or problem, while a human supervisor watches the debate process to judge which AI's argument is more persuasive and correct. This helps humans gain a deeper understanding of the complex logic or evidence presented by the AI and identify potential errors or biases, thereby improving the quality of supervision. It is similar to two human students debating with a teacher as a judge.",

First, the AI model generates various responses or actions, and a human evaluates which response is better or worse (feedback). Then, based on this human feedback data, another AI model called a 'reward model' is trained, which acts as a judge deciding whether an action is good or not. Finally, the original AI model undergoes a reinforcement learning process, improving its own behavior to receive 'praise' (high reward) from this reward model. This technique is widely used to make conversational AI systems more natural and useful.",
